The program should first input a temperature\nthen input a unit of C or F. It should then convert the temperature to the\nother unit. \n\nAfter you get it working initially, re-write it to handle bad input. \n\nExample Run 1:\n\n```\n    Enter temperature: 212\n    In which units is that: C or F? F\n    That's 100.0 C\n```\n\nExample Run 2:\n\n```\n    Enter temperature: 0\n    In which unit is that: C or F? C\n    That's 32.0 F\n```\n\nNOTE: You can find the formulas online.\n"
