Given that 1 gallon of paint covers 400 square feet, you must output the number of paint cans required to paint a rectangular room.\n\nThe program should input:\n\n- the length of the room in feet, \n- the width of the room in feet,\n- the height of the room in feet\n\nThe program should output:\n\n- total area to be painted (sum of each of the 4 walls, multiplied by the height of the room)\n- the number of gallons of paint required to paint the room.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nEnter length of room: 12\nEnter width of room: 14\nEnter height of room: 8\nTotal area to be painted: 416.00\nTotal gallons of paint requried: 2\n```\n\nHINT: Use the `math.ceil()` function to round up your number of gallons to the nearest whole number. You cannot sell fractional cans of paint!\n"
