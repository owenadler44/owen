There are 60 marshmallows in a bag.\n- Each smore requires 1 graham cracker square. There are 32 squares in a box of graham crackers.\n- Each smore requires 1 section of chocolate. There are 24 sections of chocolate in package. \n\nSo with 1 bag of marshmallows, 1 box of graham crackers, and 1 package of chocolate you can only make 24 smores (and you'll have 8 leftover crackers and 36 marshmallows).\n\nWrite a program which inputs the costs of the 1 bag of marshmallows, 1 box of graham crackers, an 1 package of chocolate, then calculates total cost and cost per smore.\n\nExample:\n\n```\nCost-per-smore calculator:\n\nInput the cost of your 1 bag of marshmallows: 2.79\nInput the cost of your 1 box of graham crackers: 2.99\nInput the cost of your 1 package of chocolate: 3.49\n\nTotal cost of items: 9.27\nCost per smore: 0.39\n```"
